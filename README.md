# menotag
MenotaG web application for transcribing, annotating, editing and analysing premodern physical sources

See also the https://menotag.ku.dk website for a functioning deployment and end-user documentation

This application is built on the Gefin framework. Once that is up and running, import menotag.sql into your mysql/mariadb database and add the 'menota' folder to the gefin root folder.
